Research as a service, the next steps of studying as you would have, except output the answer as a best fit result. Search 2.0. Starting with a UIUX POC to define this tool, as I would have already be using this for. Everyone may contribute, and eventually, it will take more than just myself alone to complete this service. Let's make it happen!

Architecture



Research as a service. Ever need to endlessly study and research for hours, and don't have the time, and it is stressful? 

Let your typical Google search output a PHD level research packet and or genetically find the fittest answer that you are needing to research. Like if you did the research and read every popular website, and used AI.

Thanks to AI, it is finally the time when I can put one of my old college theories into the making, thanks to Google, the advancement of the www, and AI. AKA the entire idea behind what education is solving for! 

AKA of why we were doing a search in the first place, and is the next level in outputting the study of education itself. It's not just a search and it's not just a book, it's everything working together to result in the summary of research.

To finally make this happen, both the internet, and AI had to be the first layer of foundation of information. Websites like stack exchange upvote ranking for incentive also were a large step in order to create research as a service.



Need to know something except you're too busy, and need the genetic best fittest result of all of your research combined on any topic? Of course, everyone does, now imagine if that research packet was neatly sitting on your desk by morning? As if AI didn't already make life easier, smoother, well now research as a service will be the next step!



In summary for POC, I am starting with the first iteration of this research as a service for UI UX design. I still need to find the fittest designs every day, and can extend this model to work for just about anything else too, if I can just get this working first. If I can get it to solve for my own POC tool needs. 

For UI UX I want every combination, best practice, color palette, ratio, 508, WCAG, AAA, design \& and layout to output best fit page designs, layouts, themes, do the what colors look best with other colors math, complete button template generation, meet professional to designer best practices, and consider the best most popular winning UIUX designs, palettes, 

and understand all of the ways that a page can look UI, understand the statistics of why a page is a favorite tool for users, and take into consideration all of the variables that both ChatGPT (OpenAI) and Google searching to basically output a genetically fittest page, palette, or other areas of UI UX design, that we do already as designers through 100s of iterations or more, 

Before we designers decide when we are happy with the fittest user experience, this will first make the best possible designs, and compare all combinations behind the scenes, keep track of the research progress of why, and output each iteration as demos stored as individual files, and can be compared easily also, so that the designer can simply choose from best fit demos that this service will output. 

Result solving for the best fittest design solving for the UI UX aka result outputting the best user experience as if every possible combination was compared. 

Resulting in the output of the overall research results, of when we designers say, "Yes we want this one.". 

Except the overall idea of research as a service, takes it one step further. That this service can run in the background as study as a service (researching), in parallel, while we are busy working on other tasks that also actually had to still be done. Research as a service in parallel, should be able to be automating a timely solution, we can then delegate our efforts to other areas of the UI todo(s) in parallel. 

Automated research progress will prove to save large amount of time, stress, and be as if the whole world is working together on what ever you use this service for, and be the result as if you did all of the research, and had hundreds of the top professionals working with you to develop the best fit solution. 

I love automation when it frees up man hours, and let's scientists do what scientists wanted to actually do. I have seen directly that solving for others repetitive hours, was more valuable than money itself, because it allowed them to go back to do their actual job that they were passionate to become.



High-level behavior:



You POST to an endpoint: “start an overnight UI/UX research job” with:



problem statement (e.g., “mobile habit tracker onboarding”),



constraints (brand colors, platform),



research duration (e.g., 8 hours) or max generations / candidates.



Service spins up a background research job that:



Iteratively generates populations of UI/UX design specs using OpenAI Responses API (via OpenAIResponseClient).



Refines prompts and search queries using:



OpenAI’s built-in web\_search tool, and/or



an external search API (Bing, Google Custom Search, etc.).



Uses a simple genetic algorithm loop:



generate candidates → score → select \& mutate → repeat.



For every candidate:



writes a standalone HTML demo file,



stores style tokens (colors, typography, layout pattern, component patterns),



tracks scores and comparisons.



At the end:



writes a research bundle (JSON + Markdown/HTML summary),



writes an index.html linking all candidate demos and showing comparison tables.



Key tech pieces:



ASP.NET Core minimal API on net10.0.



BackgroundService to keep the job running for as long as you configured.



OpenAIResponseClient (from OpenAI.Responses) for:



structured JSON design specs,



web\_search tool to help wording / research. 

GitHub



Optional SearchProvider abstraction if you want explicit Google/Bing API calls.



File output to a configurable directory.
